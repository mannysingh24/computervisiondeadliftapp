# Computer Vision Deadlift App

A simple use computer vision application used to count the reps of deadlifts by using pose estimation via video capture. Using the python libraries of mediapipe and opencv, pose estimation is easily implemented. When the camera detects that you did the full motion of a deadlift, the rep counter goes up. When the camera scans a user's motions, it has a probability scale that goes according to trained deadlift data. This is to better recognize the motions done when performing the deadlift exercise. 

This application was created using the programming language Python.
